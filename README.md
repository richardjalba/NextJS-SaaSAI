This OpenAI web app demonstrates my ability using NextJS and more technologies.

Here is where I will document my efforts in building this OpenAI app.

First I bring MongoDB and Tailwind CSS into this Next.js project for later use.

Then I set up some required routes for the app. This includes Pages, new posts, and dynamic posts.

**Auth0** is an authentication and authorization service.

Next I bring in Auth0. This involves creating a .env file with pertinent info and adding the Auth0 api for its login functionality on the homepage.
